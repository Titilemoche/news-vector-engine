Module: pipeline.nlp_modules.entities
Status: Stub / Placeholder
Description: This module is intended to extract named entities (persons, organizations,
             locations, etc.) from articles. Currently, it returns a static
             dictionary of placeholder entities.
LLM Usage: No (currently returns static data).
TODO: Implement actual entity extraction logic. This could involve using NLP
      libraries like spaCy or NLTK, or leveraging an LLM with a dedicated
      prompt in `pipeline/prompts.py`.
